With the current release you shouldn't use the jsi:: interpreter
part, because the jsc:: compiler was more tailored to support the
jsa:: assembler/accelerator generated code. It contains one
shortcut to safen the resulting php sandbox code in that strings
are pre-escaped in the parser.

You will need to comment out the line behind @WARNING1@ first to
still use the older jsi:: interpreter. (This escaping is easily
moved back into jsa::, but as that now runs nicely we don't want
to break it accidently again.) But the simple js() and js_exec()
interfaces now anyhow default to using jsa:: if it's loaded.

The interpreter also is behind the jsa:: runtime in that it does
not support the "var" statement and function definitions, not to
speak of calls. There is also a few other things were it has not
been brought on par yet, so take care.
