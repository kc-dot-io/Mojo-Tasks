- still missing expressions:
   - (a ? b : c)
   - lambda functions
- string expansion with PHP "...$variables...\n..." and backslash escaping
   - needed to take place soley in the parser
   - but only for $scalar/string variables
- bring jsi:: on par with jsa::
- implement local variable scopes differently:
   - $jsi_lvars and $jsi_lvarstack
   - or only $jsi_vars and $jsi_lvarstack, $jsi_hiddenglobalvars
- object contexts and 'new' operator
    - could be done by injecting [".type"] settings into array variable
      entries of $js_vars[],
    - and a secondary array would serve as mapping of function name vars
      to real php/functions again (the object array entry and the type
      array would simply be merged by jsi_get_var() so the _fcall() needed
      few changes)
    - gettype() would provide fallback information for standard variable
      types and so allow support for String.*() and Integer.*() methods
- function parameters pass-by-ref, only work for a limited number of
  arguments currently?
- get rid of premature string escaping in jsc:: again
- fill jsrt:: with utility code and minimal JS API
